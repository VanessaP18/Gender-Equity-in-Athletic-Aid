# Gender Equity in Athletic Aid:  
The Impact of Institutional Financial Characteristics and Student Demographics in College Sports 

This project is for my SPED 7500 final assignment. Attached are my code in R Markdown and the HTML file.
The data is from the Equity in Athletics Survey and the College Scorecard, both sourced from the U.S. Department of Education for the 2022-2023 academic year


ABSTRACT: This study examines the factors influencing the equitable dis-tribution of athletic student aid between men and women in collegiate sports. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and logistic regression modeling, the research explores how institutional characteristics, financial investments, team com-position, and student academic achievement impact the alloca-tion of athletic aid. The analysis is based on data from 773 institutions during the 2022â€“2023 academic year, sourced from the Equity in Athletics Survey and College Scorecard datasets. The findings aim to provide actionable insights to address disparities in athletic aid distribution and advance the objectives of Title IX, which mandates gender equity in educa-tion. This research highlights the complex interplay between institutional attributes and resource allocation, uncovering persistent gender inequities in collegiate sports. By emphasiz-ing the need for targeted interventions and policies, the study contributes to ongoing efforts to ensure fair opportunities and resources for all student-athletes, supporting the broader goals of equity and inclusion in collegiate sports.
